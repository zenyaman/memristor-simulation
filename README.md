## Drift diffusion approximation of resistive switching phenomenon
The most commonly understood mechanism of resistive switching in doped semi-conductor is drift and diffusion of donor.

For reduced TiO_2-x, mobile dopant is oxygen vacancy. Voltage application to the device changes the 3D oxygen vacancy distribution, resulting in resistive switching.

Here, I've created a 2D, 3D FEM simulation making it possible to link the resistive switching and oxygen vacancy distribution.
